# Amplify-Sample
Initially followed: https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/master/js/tutorials/building-ionic-4-apps/index.md

Had to make some syntax changes to get it to work

for emulator have to currently run: ionic cordova run ios -- --buildFlag="-UseModernBuildSystem=0"
see: https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/407

if you're getting an Unknown option: '--buildFlag' error run: npm install -g ionic@latest

Can run with: ionic cordova run ios -- --buildFlag="-UseModernBuildSystem=0"
or: ionic serve
node_modules
